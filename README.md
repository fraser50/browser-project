This coursework was to create a simple web browser in C#.  
This browser implemented features such as browser history, bookmarks, and setting home pages.  
The coursework specification did not ask for HTML rendering to be implemented.  

This repository contains the final version of the project as was submitted, minus the coursework specification documents.  
This courework was completed in my first semester of year 4.
